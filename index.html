        <center><p1 class="aboutp">I started my game dev journey in August of 2020. 
            I was sitting on my table thinking about what I would be when I grow up. After some time I came to a decision that I would be a game developer, because I had a very large interest in video games ever since I was 5. So after making my decision and discussing about it with my friends and family, I started to learn game development. 
            I first started by doing some research on what games are popular these days(in 2020). 
            I found out that indie games were the most popular genre. So I searched for a software to make a game. I strumbled upon Unity a free and open source game engine. So I installed unity and got to work making my first project which was an empty 3D project named "My first unity project" at first I didn't know what
            to do, because I have never used it before. So after watching some videos from a youtube channed called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys" target="_blank">Brackeys</a>, I was able to understand the basics of unity. Overtime I met some people on Discord and some of my school friends who were interested in game development too. Now I am an OK game developer and I am currently making a game with the help of my friends. There you go, that's my story.</p1></center>
